<title>Troll man and his oil.</title>

<h1>This man covered himself in oil.</h1>
<p>He expects to fly in the rain after covering himself in oil, because oil floats on water. However, there are many reasons as to why this is impossible.</p>
<h2>Slide 1</h2>
<p>This troll man is holding a cup of oil and water. He points out "Oil floats on water", as shown in the diagram. This is physically accurate, as oil is less dense than water so it would float on top. The water is heavier, so it has more downward gravitational force than the oil. This allows it to displace the oil until the bottom is entirely water molecules.</p>
<h3>Slide 2</h3>
<p>The troll man waits by the window for it to rain outside. This phenomenon is a part of the water cycle, the phase where the water which collected in the clouds becomes heavy enough to fall back down to the ground.</p>
<h4>Slide 3</h4>
<p>Now, the troll man gives an instruction similar to a tutorial to "cover yourself in oil". We can see in the image, the troll man has covered himself in a yellow liquid, presumably oil. There is also a puddle of oil massing at his feet.</p>
<h5>Slide 4</h5>
<p>The troll man begins to fly in the rain in this slide. From the context of earlier slides, because oil floats on water, the troll man flies by 'floating' on the water coming down from the sky. However, this is physically inaccurate, as covering yourself in oil does not reduce your density to the same as oil. This would not allow you to float in a pool of water, much less rain.</p>
<h6>Significance</h6>
<p>While in real life the troll man would not be able to achieve this feat, it still entertains our minds of the possibilities nobody has ever thought of. This collection of images has been seen by millions of people, and there are many variations of the 'meme' out now. It has touched, inspired, and made many people laugh throughout the world. It is crazy to think a crude 4 panel comic has had such an effect on the world, and really shows how easy it is to spread a general idea through humour.</p>
